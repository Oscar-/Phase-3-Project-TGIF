Three stretch goals in case you finish your MVP by the due date:

 Colored Text: Enhance the user interface by adding options for users to select or customize text colors.

 Add Emojis: Integrate emoji support to allow users to insert emojis into their content, adding fun and expressiveness.

 Background Styling: Offer background styling options to personalize the look and feel of the application with custom colors, gradients, or images.
